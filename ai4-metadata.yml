title: Integrated Plant Protection
summary: A Torch model to classify plants.
description: |-
  The module contains 2 fine-tuned models.
  Fine-tunning pipeline is implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) serve as the backbone architecture for classifiers.
  
  For rye images, pretrained `ResNet-34` model was used and named `rye-34`.
  For beet images, pretrained `ResNet-101` model was used and named `beet-101`.
  
  Images are preprocessed with normalization and resizing to 256x256 before being fed to the models.
  For data augmentation, training images are randomly cropped and flipped horizontally.
  The output layer of each classifier is adjusted to the number of classes
  We have `brown_rust`,`uneffected` classes for rye and `cercospora`,`uneffected` classes for beet.

  The cross-entropy loss function guides the training of machine learning models by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values
  An SGD optimizer with momentum is used to update the model weights.
  A learning rate scheduler reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 every 7 epochs.
  The training process lasts for 20 epochs per model.
